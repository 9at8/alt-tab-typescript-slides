# Intro to "Advanced" TypeScript

<!--
- Hi
- talk about TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language that came out in 2013. Instead of compiling to bytecode, it compiles to JavaScript. It's a superset of JavaScript. It adds static typing to it.

No matter what language we work with, sometimes, we want to express certain ideas in that language, but it gets pretty hard to exactly represent those ideas. I will talking about some of these ideas that can be represented in TypeScript, but it uses techniques that you dont use everyday. This talk is inspired by an npm package that I'll reveal a bit later.
-->

`TypeScript` = `static types` + `JavaScript`
`static types` = `TypeScript` - `JavaScript` ðŸ¤”

## Types as Sets

<!--
Let's get started off with some basic stuff.

We can think about types as sets. Each type represents a set of values.

- The set of booleans contains two values: true and false
- The set of numbers contain all integers and floats
- The set of strings is an infinite set of all valid strings
- Even custom types can be thought of like sets
-->

```
boolean = {true, false}
number = {-1, 2, -3, 3.14, 42, ...}
string = {"oof", "ooff", "oofff", "ooffff", ...}

interface Person {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

Person  = Forall fname in string ->
            Forall lname in string ->
              ({ firstName: fname, lastName: lname })
```

---

<!--
Let's say we need to represent a box of items. There could be anything in this box. How can we represent that?

--

But once we put something inside a box, the compiler has no way of knowing what its type is going to be later on.
-->

  ```ts
  interface Box {
    id: number
    item: any
  }

  const box: Box = { id: 42, item: "i am a string" }

  box.item
  //  ^^^^ oh no! the compiler no longer knows that it clearly is a string!
  ```

---

## Generics

<!--
This is where generics kick in.

We can create a generic Box, which can take it an item of type Item. This is very similar to how we name function parameters.
-->

  ```ts
  interface Box<Item> {
    id: number
    item: Item
  }

  const stringBox: Box<string> = { id: 42, item: "i am a string" }
  const numberBox: Box<number> = { id: 24, item: 1 }

  stringBox.item  // <- the compiler knows that item is a string
  numberBox.item  // <- the compiler knows that item is a number
  ```

---

<!--
What if we only wanted boxes of strings and numbers? We can use the extends keyword along with a type union
-->

  ```ts
  interface Box<Item extends string | number> {
    id: number
    item: Item
  }

  const stringBox: Box<string> = { id: 42, item: "i am a string" }
  const numberBox: Box<number> = { id: 24, item: 1 }
  const boolBox: Box<boolean> = { id: -42, item: true }
  //                 ^^^^^^^
  // Type 'boolean' does not satisfy the constraint 'string | number'.
  ```

---

<!--
Lets say our boxes have more boxes inside them. We want to able to look at the type of the item in the innermost box easily. We can use the infer keyword along with recursive types for this
-->

  ```ts
  type Unbox<TBox> = TBox extends Box<infer Item>
    ? Item extends Box<any>
      ? Unbox<Item>
      : Item
    : never

  const strBox = { id: 42, item: "i am a string" }
  const strBoxBox = { id: 24, item: strBox }

  type InnerType1 = Unbox<typeof strBox>
  //   ^^^^^^^^^^ string
  type InnerType2 = Unbox<typeof strBoxBox>
  //   ^^^^^^^^^^ string
  ```

---

## `meta-typing` package

https://github.com/ronami/meta-typing

<!--
The rest of the talk will be focused on the meta-typing package. This package provides a bunch of utilities for TypeScript that can be used during compile time. All the code in the slides has been more or less directly copied from that package.
-->

---

## Incrementing and decrementing numbers

<!--
TypeScript type system does not have arithmetic in it
-->

  ```ts
  type IncTable = { 0: 1; 1: 2; 2: 3; 3: 4; 4: 5; 5: 6; 6: 7; 7: 8; 8: 9; 9: 10 };

  type DecTable = { 10: 9; 9: 8; 8: 7; 7: 6; 6: 5; 5: 4; 4: 3; 3: 2; 2: 1; 1: 0 };

  type Inc<T extends number> = T extends keyof IncTable
    ? IncTable[T]
    : never;

  type Dec<T extends number> = T extends keyof DecTable
    ? DecTable[T]
    : never;

  type Two = Inc<1>
  type One = Dec<Inc<1>>
  ```

---

## Head and tail of a list

  ```ts
  type Head<T extends Array<any>> =
    T extends [any, ...Array<any>]
      ? T['0']
      : never;

  type Tail<T extends Array<any>> =
    T extends [any, ...infer Rest]
      ? Rest
      : never;
  ```

---

## Less than or equal to

  ```ts
  // `true` if `A` is smaller than or equals to `B`, `false` otherwise
  type Lte<A extends number, B extends number> =
    IsNever<A> extends true
    ? IsNever<B> extends true
      ? true
      : false
    : Lte<Inc<A>, Inc<B>>;

  /*
    Lte<8, 9> = Lte<9, 10> = Lte<10, never> = Lte<never, never> = true
    Lte<9, 8> = Lte<10, 9> = Lte<never, 10> = false
   */
  ```

---

# THE BIG REVEAL

---

## Insertion sort

  ```ts
  type Insert<
    N extends number,
    R extends number[]
  > = R extends []
    ? [N]
    : Lte<N, Head<R>> extends true
      ? [N, ...R]
      : [
          Head<R>,
          ...Insert<N, Cast<Tail<R>, number[]>>
        ]
  ```

---

  ```ts
  type InsertionSort<
    T extends number[],
    R extends number[] = []
  > = T extends []
    ? R
    : InsertionSort<
        Cast<Tail<T>, number[]>,
        Insert<Head<T>, R>
      >
  ```
